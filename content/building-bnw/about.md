This website was built with GatsbyJS, which is a bundler of sorts for all sorts of javascript frameworks.

It uses Typescript, GraphQL, Webpack, Babel, React, and a whole handful of other libraries to get the job done.  These articles are being parsed from raw markdown, and this whole static site is being served via AWS S3.  

All of these technologies on their own collectively have hundreds of years of development time, but I can wonder over to GitHub and spin up a little blog in an afternoon.

But do I really understand what's going on?
