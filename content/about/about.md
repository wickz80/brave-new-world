Dave is a full-stack developer for a famous video streaming service, and enjoys strong coffee and long walks on the beach.  Wait, why am I writing this in third person?

I like to play with code, so I've made this little site to document my journey from script kiddie to senior script adult.  I'm not too sure what I'll put here yet, but it'll likely be an amalgam of code articles, philosophical musings, things about my cars, and whatever else I feel like posting.
