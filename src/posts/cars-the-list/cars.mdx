I've owned a lot of cars. I don't think I've ever summed them up in one place. Here goes.

---------

#### #1

1997 Volvo 850 (T5) wagon. Silver.  My first car, freedom for a 16 year old.  Boxy, silver, and Swedish, these old Volvos will always have a soft spot in my heart.  It had a good 5-cylinder motor with a turbo, but didn't handle all too well.  I remember soldering in an AUX port, so I could listen to my iPod.  I did found a tuning chip on eBay, and paid a local TV repair shop to solder it in for me.  On the first test drive, it blew off the charge intake... Served me well for a year, before I found my next true love...

#### #2

1988 Toyota 4Runner SR5.  V6, Manual, Cherry on White.  I loved this car.  It was janky, it was old, but the thing had attitude and was built like a tank.  The e-brake never worked, so I had to put it in gear when I parked it.  One time, I parked on a hill, went to school, and came back to a missing truck.  It had rolled into a snowbank down the way.  I just drove it out, that was the end of it.

#### #3

1978 Datsun 280z.  Black on black, manual.  Of all my cars, I think I miss this one the most.  What was supposed to be a joint project car between me and my dad became my own project.  I completely redid the suspension, interior, paint, and wheels.  The engine was rock solid.  I kept it for at least 5 years, and regrettably sold it once I moved to Texas.

#### #4

2002? Saab 9-5.  Swedish engineering.  Built from Jets.  This car was unremarkable winter beater.  It had a 4 cylinder turbo, made some good power with a chip tune.  Unfortunately it fell victim to a snowplow that backed up into it.  I made a cash deal with the guy, and let it go on Craigslist.

#### #5

2007 Subaru WRX, Black on tan, 5 speed.  The WRXs are a ton of fun.  AWD, turbo, manual transmission -- all the right ingredients.  This one was salvage title, but the Ukrainian owner assurred me it was in good shape.  I delivered pizzas in it for one winter... with snow tires, it was unstoppable.  Also had some subwoofers taking up most of the trunk.  Eventually, I ended up putting a downpipe, exhaust, tune, and suspension on it, before eventually finding something better...

#### #6

2011 BMW M3, Competition Pack.  White on black leather.  Gorgeous car.  Insane V8, that revved up to almost 9 grand without breaking a sweat.  Almost immediately after buying it, I put on cat-less downpipes, a catback exhaust, and tune.  The sound it made at 8,500 RPM is what dreams are made of.  Had a lot of fun autocrossing it and going fast.  Helluva car.

#### #7

1985 BMW 535i.  Cosmosblau Metallic on Pacific Blue interior, 5 speed.  This car was (and is) a great project car.  And by great, I mean expensive, time-consuming, and a labor of love.  I bought it in rough shape, and put a rebuilt M30B35 engine in it from a 735i.  Then I put it on airbags and BBS wheels.  It still needs a lot of work, but this car has so much swagger to it.

#### #8

1988 BMW 735i, Black on Red, 5sp.  Not too much to be said about this car... I bought it broken, had it towed to my place, and stole the engine and transmission.  I parted it out some more, and then got rid of the shell on Craigslist.  It was on cut springs and beat up BBS wheels, with a nasty matte black rattle-can paint job.  But it's heart lives on.

#### #9

2016 BMW M3, 6 speed, Mineralgrau Metallic on Black cloth.  The newest member of the family -- the secondm M3 is an absolute beast.  Gorgeous, over the top, torquey, and full of tech, this car tries to be everything at once.  Family sedan, track toy, luxury cruiser.  I'm still just getting to know it.
